#Maze Generation
A project in creating a python based maze generator. The GUI of choice is
turtle for usability. MazeGenerator.py has limited features and no solve
functionality. I've limited the sizes of the mazes to be from 3 to 30 nodes.
There can also be multiple solutions for any given maze. The next planned
iteration will store the data more effectively and run more efficiently. Also,
I plan on including a solution path with the next version. 

Run with `MazeGenerator2.py 30` to get a full sized maze in the terminal.
